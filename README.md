# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++  

## Description  
This project is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, developed in C++. It allows two players to compete by taking turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The game determines the winner based on traditional Tic-Tac-Toe rules and declares a draw if no moves are left.

## Features  
- Two-player mode with player names input.  
- Dynamic game board display after each move.  
- Turn-based gameplay with clear prompts.  
- Logic to check for winning conditions or a draw.  
- Simple, easy-to-read code structure using functions.

## How to Run  
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler, e.g., `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ tictactoe.cpp -o tictactoe
